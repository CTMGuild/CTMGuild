### Parent Guild

This guild is a child of the guild linked in the .gg submodule.

As a child guild, the CTM Guild reserves the right to maintain their own membership, contracts, and ledger, so long as they do not conflict with those of the parent.

The CTM Guild agrees to recognize all transctions on the parent ledger.  

The CTM Guild agrees to abide by the charter of the parent guild, and the valid votes of the parent guild's members. The CTM Guild will maintain it's own membership and ledger, and will issue a CTM Guild Coin (GCTM).

The CTM Guild asks that the parent guild recognize their ledger and contracts by hashing a submodule link to their chain. The CTM Guild asks for preferential treatment in feature requests for projects governed by the parent guild.
